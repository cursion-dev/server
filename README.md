## Environment

Prior to running app, configure all env's located in the /env directory. There are example .env files for both production and local environments marked `.env.dev.example` and `.env.prod.example`. Prior to running the app, be sure to update with your unique keys, domains, passwords, etc, and remove the `.example` extention from the files.  **Never store actual .env's in a repo.** Things to change:
- high level django configs
- admin credentials 
- email credentials
- database configs
- google API keys
- stripe keys
- OAuth keys
- twilio credentials
- slack credentials
- s3 remote storage credentials
